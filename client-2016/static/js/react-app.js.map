Most commonly\n\t * it's used to animate the mounting and unmounting of a component, but can also\n\t * be used to describe in-place transition states as well.\n\t *\n\t * ---\n\t *\n\t * **Note**: `Transition` is a platform-agnostic base component. If you're using\n\t * transitions in CSS, you'll probably want to use\n\t * [`CSSTransition`](https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/css-transition)\n\t * instead. It inherits all the features of `Transition`, but contains\n\t * additional features necessary to play nice with CSS transitions (hence the\n\t * name of the component).\n\t *\n\t * ---\n\t *\n\t * By default the `Transition` component does not alter the behavior of the\n\t * component it renders, it only tracks \"enter\" and \"exit\" states for the\n\t * components. It's up to you to give meaning and effect to those states. For\n\t * example we can add styles to a component when it enters or exits:\n\t *\n\t * ```jsx\n\t * import { Transition } from 'react-transition-group';\n\t *\n\t * const duration = 300;\n\t *\n\t * const defaultStyle = {\n\t *   transition: `opacity ${duration}ms ease-in-out`,\n\t *   opacity: 0,\n\t * }\n\t *\n\t * const transitionStyles = {\n\t *   entering: { opacity: 0 },\n\t *   entered:  { opacity: 1 },\n\t * };\n\t *\n\t * const Fade = ({ in: inProp }) => (\n\t *   <Transition in={inProp} timeout={duration}>\n\t *     {state => (\n\t *       <div style={{\n\t *         ...defaultStyle,\n\t *         ...transitionStyles[state]\n\t *       }}>\n\t *         I'm a fade Transition!\n\t *       </div>\n\t *     )}\n\t *   </Transition>\n\t * );\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * There are 4 main states a Transition can be in:\n\t *  - `'entering'`\n\t *  - `'entered'`\n\t *  - `'exiting'`\n\t *  - `'exited'`\n\t *\n\t * Transition state is toggled via the `in` prop. When `true` the component\n\t * begins the \"Enter\" stage. During this stage, the component will shift from\n\t * its current transition state, to `'entering'` for the duration of the\n\t * transition and then to the `'entered'` stage once it's complete.

Most commonly\n * it's used to animate the mounting and unmounting of a component, but can also\n * be used to describe in-place transition states as well.\n *\n * ---\n *\n * **Note**: `Transition` is a platform-agnostic base component. If you're using\n * transitions in CSS, you'll probably want to use\n * [`CSSTransition`](https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/css-transition)\n * instead. It inherits all the features of `Transition`, but contains\n * additional features necessary to play nice with CSS transitions (hence the\n * name of the component).\n *\n * ---\n *\n * By default the `Transition` component does not alter the behavior of the\n * component it renders, it only tracks \"enter\" and \"exit\" states for the\n * components. It's up to you to give meaning and effect to those states. For\n * example we can add styles to a component when it enters or exits:\n *\n * ```jsx\n * import { Transition } from 'react-transition-group';\n *\n * const duration = 300;\n *\n * const defaultStyle = {\n *   transition: `opacity ${duration}ms ease-in-out`,\n *   opacity: 0,\n * }\n *\n * const transitionStyles = {\n *   entering: { opacity: 0 },\n *   entered:  { opacity: 1 },\n * };\n *\n * const Fade = ({ in: inProp }) => (\n *   <Transition in={inProp} timeout={duration}>\n *     {state => (\n *       <div style={{\n *         ...defaultStyle,\n *         ...transitionStyles[state]\n *       }}>\n *         I'm a fade Transition!\n *       </div>\n *     )}\n *   </Transition>\n * );\n * ```\n *\n * There are 4 main states a Transition can be in:\n *  - `'entering'`\n *  - `'entered'`\n *  - `'exiting'`\n *  - `'exited'`\n *\n * Transition state is toggled via the `in` prop. When `true` the component\n * begins the \"Enter\" stage. During this stage, the component will shift from\n * its current transition state, to `'entering'` for the duration of the\n * transition and then to the `'entered'` stage once it's complete. Let's take\n * the following example (we'll use the\n * [useState](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usestate) hook):\n *\n * ```jsx\n * function App() {\n *   const [inProp, setInProp] = useState(false);\n *   return (\n *     <div>\n *       <Transition in={inProp} timeout={500}>\n *         {state => (\n *           // ...\n *         )}\n *       </Transition>\n *       <button onClick={() => setInProp(true)}>\n *         Click to Enter\n *       </button>\n *     </div>\n *   );\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * When the button is clicked the component will shift to the `'entering'` state\n * and stay there for 500ms (the value of `timeout`) before it finally switches\n * to `'entered'`.\n *\n * When `in` is `false` the same thing happens except the state moves from\n * `'exiting'` to `'exited'`.\n */\n\nexports.EXITING = EXITING;\n\nvar Transition =\n/*#__PURE__*/\nfunction (_React$Component) {\n  _inheritsLoose(Transition, _React$Component);\n\n  function Transition(props, context) {\n    var _this;\n\n    _this = _React$Component.call(this, props, context) || this;\n    var parentGroup = context.transitionGroup; // In the context of a TransitionGroup all enters are really appears\n\n    var appear = parentGroup && !parentGroup.isMounting ?

The only third party library used is Socket.IO to aid with client-server communication. The rest is raw JavaScript. Most game engines for MMO's use game loops which is often a waste of resources, especially considering there are no graphics to update on the server. So instead of calculating movement and collisions through the traditional method (checking if objects 'cross over' each other 20-30 times per second), it uses an events-based system; objects are updated, and collisions are calculated (via mathematical interpolation) only when events are generated by users or generated from collisions.\"}</p>\n\n      <p>{\"The collision engine was the main hurdle. First it calculates if a collision will occur in the first place, and if so, how long from now, but only provided the colliding objects remain on course. If any of the objects change size or direction then the 'not yet activated' collision event is cancelled. In theory, this should substantially reduce server load due to only needing to update objects, calculate collisions and send messages to each player as and when events occur, rather than 20-30 times per second as is usually the case with game loops.\"}</p>\n\n      <p>{\"It works best with slower paced games with not too many players/NPCs where events will (on avg.) occur less than 20 times per second. If there are more than ~25 events occuring per second then it may start to perform worse than the traditional method. For now, I have only made it to work between circular objects. Objects of other shapes (maybe except ellipses) will likely require a completely different algorithm. Modifying the current algorithm to work with ellipses and an algorithm to work with any polygon (with all angles &lt;180 degrees) should be able to cover all cases.\"}</p>\n    </div>\n  </section>\n);\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/components/Projects/GameProj.js","import React from 'react';\nimport {Route} from 'react-router-dom';\nimport RoomProj from './RoomProj';\nimport ApProj from './ApProj';\nimport NbProj from './GameProj';\nimport NodeSocial from 'node-social';\nimport ProjectThumbnails from '@components/ProjectThumbnails/ProjectThumbnails';\nimport {AuthRoute} from '@lib/CustomRoutes';\nimport {connect} from 'react-redux';\n\nimport text from '@styles/text.css';\nimport position from '@styles/position.css';\n\n\n\n//temp\nimport {Link} from 'react-router-dom';\n\nconst Projects = props => {\n  return (\n    <div style={{height: '100%'}}>\n      <Route exact path={props.match.path} render={() => (\n        <div className={position.center}>\n          <div className={`${text.title}`}>Projects</div>\n          <ProjectThumbnails/>\n        </div>\n      )}/>\n      <Route path={`${props.match.path}/Room`} component={RoomProj}/>\n      <Route path={`${props.match.path}/ApProj`} component={ApProj}/>\n      <Route path={`${props.match.path}/GameProj`} component={NbProj}/>\n      <AuthRoute style={{padding: '0 40px 40px 40px'}} user={props.user} path={`${props.match.path}/NodeSocial`} component={NodeSocial}/>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nfunction mapStateToProps(state){\n  return {user: state.user};\n}\n\nexport default connect(mapStateToProps)(Projects);\n\n\n//<AuthRoute style={{marginTop: 100 + 'px'}} path={`${props.match.path}/NodeSocial`} component={NodeSocial}/>\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/components/Projects/Projects.js","import React from 'react';\n\nexport default () => <div className=\"col-md-10 col-md-offset-1\"><br/>See <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/Git-Ashley/room-samples/blob/master/api-docs.md\">API docs</a> on Github.</div>;\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/components/Projects/RoomProj/ApiDocs.js","import React from 'react';\nimport ScriptLoader from '@services/ScriptLoader';\nimport {Link} from 'react-router-dom';\n\nexport default class RoomProj extends React.Component {\n  render(){\n    return (\n      <section className=\"col-md-10 col-md-offset-1\">\n        <h2 style={{textAlign: 'center'}}><b>Room pattern</b></h2>\n\n        <h3><b>Summary</b></h3>\n        <p>\n        {`The Room package is designed to be used whenever there are multiple clients communicating with each other via a central server.

The server side module exports a class, `}<a href=\"https://github.com/Git-Ashley/room-samples/blob/master/api-docs.md#class-room\" target=\"_blank\">Room</a>{`, which is intended to be extended from, and exposes hooks, while `}<a href=\"https://github.com/Git-Ashley/room-samples/blob/master/api-docs.md#client-side-module\" target=\"_blank\">the client side module</a>{` is simpler and is designed to be an interface to the corresponding room on the server. There are 6 samples which walk you through how to use the room package to build a chat-room. Sample 1 shows simple setup, and a feature-less basic chat-room. Samples 2 - 5 each demonstrate a different feature; Disconect/reconnect functionality, permissions, initialization and multiple rooms of the same type, while sample 6 demonstrates them all working together.`}\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        {`The server side Room module stores clients by session ID, which has a natural side effect of multiple clients over different devices being able to log into the same user unless you choose to disallow it via the `} <a href=\"https://github.com/Git-Ashley/room-samples/blob/master/api-docs.md#hook-roomonjoinrequestclient-userinfo\" target=\"_blank\">permission hook</a>{`.`}\n        </p>\n        <h4><b>Client Pooling</b></h4>\n        <p>\n        <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/Git-Ashley/room-samples/blob/master/api-docs.md#class-client\">Client</a>{` objects are created to represent each client session, and placed in a client pool so that each Room can share the client connection. This client pool is not exposed to code using the module. Clients are automatically removed from the pool if they are no longer in any rooms which it provides for.`}\n        </p>\n        <h4><b>Socket Handler</b></h4>\n        <p>\n        {`The Room pattern makes use of the SocketHandler class, with each `}<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/Git-Ashley/room-samples/blob/master/api-docs.md#class-client\">client</a>{` object on the server containing a SocketHandler. The SocketHandler could (and will) be its own module. It is a wrapper for the raw websocket and handles the disconnect/reconnect functionality with pings/pongs, and emits 'disconnect' upon disconnecting, in which case the client side SocketHandler goes into reconnect mode, and the SocketHandler will emit 'reconnect' upon reconnecting, with the ability the reassign the raw websocket reference to the new one. It also follows socket.io's message sending style of emitting an event with a payload. You may be wondering why I haven't just used socket.io instead, for which there are many reasons beyond the scope of this article, but among them, are its performance and size. The client-side code for the SocketHandler can be found `}<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/Git-Ashley/client-room/blob/master/Sockets.js\">here</a>{` and the server-side code `}<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/Git-Ashley/server-room/blob/master/ClientPool/SocketHandler.js\">here</a>{`. The main difference between the two is the implemention of ping/pong functionality on the server, _reconnect method on the client, as well as the clients _enqueue function which is necessary incase messages are sent while the connection is initializing. Other than that they are very similar.`}\n        </p>\n      </section>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/components/Projects/RoomProj/Description.js","import React from 'react';\nimport ScriptLoader from '@services/ScriptLoader';\nimport {Link} from 'react-router-dom';\n\nexport default class RoomProj extends React.Component {\n  constructor(){\n    super();\n\n    ScriptLoader([\n      \"https://cdn.rawgit.com/google/code-prettify/master/loader/run_prettify.js\"\n    ], () => window.PR.prettyPrint());\n  }\n\n  render(){\n    return (\n      <section className=\"col-md-10 col-md-offset-1\">\n        <h2 style={{textAlign: 'center'}}><b>Samples</b></h2>\n        <div>There are 6 samples:</div>\n        <ul>\n          <li><a href=\"https://github.com/Git-Ashley/room-samples/tree/master/sample-1\" target=\"_blank\">Sample 1: Basics</a></li>\n          <li><a href=\"https://github.com/Git-Ashley/room-samples/tree/master/sample-2\" target=\"_blank\">Sample 2: Disconnecting & reconnecting</a></li>\n          <li><a href=\"https://github.com/Git-Ashley/room-samples/tree/master/sample-3\" target=\"_blank\">Sample 3: Permissions</a></li>\n          <li><a href=\"https://github.com/Git-Ashley/room-samples/tree/master/sample-4\" target=\"_blank\">Sample 4: Initialization hook</a></li>\n          <li><a href=\"https://github.com/Git-Ashley/room-samples/tree/master/sample-5\" target=\"_blank\">Sample 5: Multiple rooms of the same type</a></li>\n          <li><a href=\"https://github.com/Git-Ashley/room-samples/tree/master/sample-6\" target=\"_blank\">Sample 6: Everything together</a></li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <br/>\n        <h4><b>Sample 1: Basics</b></h4>\n        <p>\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/Git-Ashley/room-samples/tree/master/sample-1\">Sample 1</a>{` is a simple chat room example.
