Most commonly\n\t * it's used to animate the mounting and unmounting of a component, but can also\n\t * be used to describe in-place transition states as well.\n\t *\n\t * ---\n\t *\n\t * **Note**: `Transition` is a platform-agnostic base component. If you're using\n\t * transitions in CSS, you'll probably want to use\n\t * [`CSSTransition`](https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/css-transition)\n\t * instead. It inherits all the features of `Transition`, but contains\n\t * additional features necessary to play nice with CSS transitions (hence the\n\t * name of the component).\n\t *\n\t * ---\n\t *\n\t * By default the `Transition` component does not alter the behavior of the\n\t * component it renders, it only tracks \"enter\" and \"exit\" states for the\n\t * components. It's up to you to give meaning and effect to those states. For\n\t * example we can add styles to a component when it enters or exits:\n\t *\n\t * ```jsx\n\t * import { Transition } from 'react-transition-group';\n\t *\n\t * const duration = 300;\n\t *\n\t * const defaultStyle = {\n\t *   transition: `opacity ${duration}ms ease-in-out`,\n\t *   opacity: 0,\n\t * }\n\t *\n\t * const transitionStyles = {\n\t *   entering: { opacity: 0 },\n\t *   entered:  { opacity: 1 },\n\t * };\n\t *\n\t * const Fade = ({ in: inProp }) => (\n\t *   <Transition in={inProp} timeout={duration}>\n\t *     {state => (\n\t *       <div style={{\n\t *         ...defaultStyle,\n\t *         ...transitionStyles[state]\n\t *       }}>\n\t *         I'm a fade Transition!\n\t *       </div>\n\t *     )}\n\t *   </Transition>\n\t * );\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * There are 4 main states a Transition can be in:\n\t *  - `'entering'`\n\t *  - `'entered'`\n\t *  - `'exiting'`\n\t *  - `'exited'`\n\t *\n\t * Transition state is toggled via the `in` prop. When `true` the component\n\t * begins the \"Enter\" stage. During this stage, the component will shift from\n\t * its current transition state, to `'entering'` for the duration of the\n\t * transition and then to the `'entered'` stage once it's complete.

Most commonly\n * it's used to animate the mounting and unmounting of a component, but can also\n * be used to describe in-place transition states as well.\n *\n * ---\n *\n * **Note**: `Transition` is a platform-agnostic base component. If you're using\n * transitions in CSS, you'll probably want to use\n * [`CSSTransition`](https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/css-transition)\n * instead. It inherits all the features of `Transition`, but contains\n * additional features necessary to play nice with CSS transitions (hence the\n * name of the component).\n *\n * ---\n *\n * By default the `Transition` component does not alter the behavior of the\n * component it renders, it only tracks \"enter\" and \"exit\" states for the\n * components. It's up to you to give meaning and effect to those states. For\n * example we can add styles to a component when it enters or exits:\n *\n * ```jsx\n * import { Transition } from 'react-transition-group';\n *\n * const duration = 300;\n *\n * const defaultStyle = {\n *   transition: `opacity ${duration}ms ease-in-out`,\n *   opacity: 0,\n * }\n *\n * const transitionStyles = {\n *   entering: { opacity: 0 },\n *   entered:  { opacity: 1 },\n * };\n *\n * const Fade = ({ in: inProp }) => (\n *   <Transition in={inProp} timeout={duration}>\n *     {state => (\n *       <div style={{\n *         ...defaultStyle,\n *         ...transitionStyles[state]\n *       }}>\n *         I'm a fade Transition!\n *       </div>\n *     )}\n *   </Transition>\n * );\n * ```\n *\n * There are 4 main states a Transition can be in:\n *  - `'entering'`\n *  - `'entered'`\n *  - `'exiting'`\n *  - `'exited'`\n *\n * Transition state is toggled via the `in` prop. When `true` the component\n * begins the \"Enter\" stage. During this stage, the component will shift from\n * its current transition state, to `'entering'` for the duration of the\n * transition and then to the `'entered'` stage once it's complete. Let's take\n * the following example (we'll use the\n * [useState](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usestate) hook):\n *\n * ```jsx\n * function App() {\n *   const [inProp, setInProp] = useState(false);\n *   return (\n *     <div>\n *       <Transition in={inProp} timeout={500}>\n *         {state => (\n *           // ...\n *         )}\n *       </Transition>\n *       <button onClick={() => setInProp(true)}>\n *         Click to Enter\n *       </button>\n *     </div>\n *   );\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * When the button is clicked the component will shift to the `'entering'` state\n * and stay there for 500ms (the value of `timeout`) before it finally switches\n * to `'entered'`.\n *\n * When `in` is `false` the same thing happens except the state moves from\n * `'exiting'` to `'exited'`.\n */\n\nexports.EXITING = EXITING;\n\nvar Transition =\n/*#__PURE__*/\nfunction (_React$Component) {\n  _inheritsLoose(Transition, _React$Component);\n\n  function Transition(props, context) {\n    var _this;\n\n    _this = _React$Component.call(this, props, context) || this;\n    var parentGroup = context.transitionGroup; // In the context of a TransitionGroup all enters are really appears\n\n    var appear = parentGroup && !parentGroup.isMounting ?

First it calculates if a collision will occur in the first place, and if so, how long from now, but only provided the colliding objects remain on course. If any of the objects change size or direction then the 'not yet activated' collision event is cancelled. In theory, this should substantially reduce server load due to only needing to update objects, calculate collisions and send messages to each player as and when events occur, rather than 20-30 times per second as is usually the case with game loops.\"}</p>\n\n      <p>{\"It works best with slower paced games with not too many players/NPCs where events will (on avg.) occur less than 20 times per second. If there are more than ~25 events occuring per second then it may start to perform worse than the traditional method. For now, I have only made it to work between circular objects.

There are 6 samples which walk you through how to use the room package to build a chat-room. Sample 1 shows simple setup, and a feature-less basic chat-room. Samples 2 - 5 each demonstrate a different feature; Disconect/reconnect functionality, permissions, initialization and multiple rooms of the same type, while sample 6 demonstrates them all working together.`}\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        {`The server side Room module stores clients by session ID, which has a natural side effect of multiple clients over different devices being able to log into the same user unless you choose to disallow it via the `} <a href=\"https://github.com/Git-Ashley/room-samples/blob/master/api-docs.md#hook-roomonjoinrequestclient-userinfo\" target=\"_blank\">permission hook</a>{`.`}\n        </p>\n        <h4><b>Client Pooling</b></h4>\n        <p>\n        <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/Git-Ashley/room-samples/blob/master/api-docs.md#class-client\">Client</a>{` objects are created to represent each client session, and placed in a client pool so that each Room can share the client connection.

The SocketHandler could (and will) be its own module. It is a wrapper for the raw websocket and handles the disconnect/reconnect functionality with pings/pongs, and emits 'disconnect' upon disconnecting, in which case the client side SocketHandler goes into reconnect mode, and the SocketHandler will emit 'reconnect' upon reconnecting, with the ability the reassign the raw websocket reference to the new one. It also follows socket.io's message sending style of emitting an event with a payload. You may be wondering why I haven't just used socket.io instead, for which there are many reasons beyond the scope of this article, but among them, are its performance and size. The client-side code for the SocketHandler can be found `}<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/Git-Ashley/client-room/blob/master/Sockets.js\">here</a>{` and the server-side code `}<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/Git-Ashley/server-room/blob/master/ClientPool/SocketHandler.js\">here</a>{`.
